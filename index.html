        <div class="infoTile">The above before-and-after photos show an example of algae on traditional residential housing siding that we treated  with a chemical mixture at low pressure and then rinsed at medium pressure, leaving the surface nice and clean afterwards without splintering the delicate house siding. 
            <br>
            This process enabled the residents to apply their own coats of paint to the building without having to hire painting contractors, saving them thousands of dollars for their DIY painting project.
